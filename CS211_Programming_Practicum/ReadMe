                    211 IN MY EYES

CS211 is not a hard but also is not an easy class.
There had many projects that I needed to do.
I have to admit that CS211 was the first meaningful CS class for me.
I learned 
  Structure: Link-list, Dynamic Array....
  Language: C, C++
  How to Debug...
  How to makefile..
  
It was more like a foundation class that helped you in the future of your coding life.
Appreciate Professor Troy, a very nice guy....

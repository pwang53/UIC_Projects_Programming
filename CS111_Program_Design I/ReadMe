CS111 was my first cs course in UIC
The language was Python
It also was my first time to draw the picture by using a tortoise in the computer
The class was fun. 
I think it was designed for those who were intereted in CS.
The coding is also very cool.
Unlike C and C++
Python's logic and grammar is easier
I can also realize some goals easier than using C

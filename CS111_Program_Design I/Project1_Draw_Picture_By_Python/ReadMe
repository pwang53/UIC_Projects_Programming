The first projects for CS111 was using python
to draw any simple picture that you want, and
then put that picture on a .jpg or any other 
pic file.

It was like a simpe Photoshop,
for me I drew a cake and after that
I can put that cake on whichever photo I want.
The wowPic.jpg was the photo after my Python Photoshop

For me, it was more like a photo sticker,
you use python to create a sticker you want
and put it on the photo you like

Try to run my code. Happy to hear any suggestions

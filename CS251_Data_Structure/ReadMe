CS251
For me, I think this should be the most difficult cs class in my level right now.
It introduces many different data structures for my future programming.
Although I didn't get a good grade and study that well, it is the most importanct cs class.
    Binary Search Tree, 
    Runtime calculation, 
    Linked-list Problem, 
    AVL Tree,
    Algorithm Analysis,
    etc....
It is a cs basement class which I think I need many time to learn and understand
Enjoy.

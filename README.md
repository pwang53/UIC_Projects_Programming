# UIC_Projects_Programming
It is the repository about my CS studying life in UIC, which is also my first touch to CS. Lovely Class.
Maybe there will be harder programming or work in my life, but this will be my first cs learning experience.
Never forget where you start and your beginning wherever you are.
Good luck!PQ!
